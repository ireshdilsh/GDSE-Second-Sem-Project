            <h2>4. Limitations</h2>
            <p>
              In no event shall our company or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, 
              without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) 
              arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on our website, even if we or 
              our authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility 
              of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, 
              or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations 
              may not apply to you.
