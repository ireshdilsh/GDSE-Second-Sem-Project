🌱 Urban Garden Swap — “Grow & Swap”
A platform for city dwellers to swap homegrown fruits, vegetables, herbs, and plants.

🔷 Concept:
Many urban residents grow small amounts of produce (e.g., basil, tomatoes, chillies, microgreens) on balconies, rooftops, or in community gardens.
But they usually can’t grow everything they need, and surplus goes to waste.

Grow & Swap is a community platform where users can:

List the produce they’re growing and what they’re willing to swap.

Browse what others have to offer nearby.

Schedule swaps or deliveries.

Share growing tips, recipes, and local gardening events.

🔷 Key Features:
✅ User accounts & profiles with location and garden details.
✅ Inventory: add/remove crops with photos & availability.
✅ Search by crop or location radius.
✅ Request a swap or offer your items to someone.
✅ Messaging/chat for arranging pickup or delivery.
✅ Points system or badges for active swappers.
✅ Blog or tips section to keep people engaged.

🔷 Why it’s a good idea:
Supports sustainability and reduces food waste.

Builds local community connections.

Works even in urban areas with limited space.

Potential for future monetization: premium delivery, workshops, affiliate seeds/tools.
