An **Online Course Buying Website** is an **excellent idea** even for a second-semester project — *if you keep the scope simple*. It touches on real-world e-commerce + education problems and lets you practice full-stack development using **HTML, CSS, JS + Spring Boot**.

---

## ✅ Why It’s a Good Choice:

* **Real-World Problem:** Students often struggle to find quality courses in one place.
* **Clear Business Use Case:** Course marketplace like Udemy or Skillshare.
* **Great for Learning:** You’ll implement product listing, cart, user login, and backend logic.
* **Easy to expand:** You can later add reviews, video content, admin dashboard, etc.

## 🔧 MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Scope — Ideal for You

### 👤 1. **User System**

* Register & login (Spring Security optional)
* Role: Student (Buyer), Admin (Course manager)

### 📚 2. **Course Management**

* Admin can: Add, edit, delete courses (title, price, description, category)
* User can: View all courses (search, filter)

### 🛒 3. **Cart & Purchase**

* User can add course to cart
* Checkout to “buy” course (you can simulate payment)

### 📂 4. **My Courses (After Purchase)**

* User can view a list of purchased courses (like a dashboard)

## 🌐 Technologies to Use

| Layer    | Technology                        |

## 📦 Suggested Folder Structure (Spring Boot)

```
com.onlinecourse
├── controller
├── service
├── repository
├── model
├── dto
└── config
```

---

## 🖼️ UI Pages You Can Create

1. `index.html` – Homepage showing featured courses
2. `courses.html` – All course listings
3. `course-details.html` – Single course view with "Add to Cart"
4. `cart.html` – View and checkout cart
5. `login.html` / `register.html`
6. `admin-dashboard.html` – For course management

---

## 💡 Advanced (If you want to expand later)

* Rating & reviews
* File upload (PDF, video preview)
* Real payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal)
* JWT authentication

---

## ⚠️ Tips

* Keep video upload out for now (just simulate).
* Cart can be simple — store it in session or use frontend storage.
* For purchase, just save the course in a "purchased" table (no real payment needed).
* Focus on clean UI + well-structured backend.

### ✅ Verdict: YES — A great second-semester project!

If you keep it to a **basic marketplace**, it’s achievable and impressive.
